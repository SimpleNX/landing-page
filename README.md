## What the website is about
----

The website serves as a template page for a business that wants to showcase their products and
provide customers with a webpage to interact with the business.

## What I have learnt and implemented

I have learnt how to add styles to a HTML document, and arrange various elements
in a HTML document as boxes and in a bigger view, arranging various boxes as flexbox
as required.

Namingly, writing css files, the box model, and using flexboxes to arrange boxes.
